# linux-daemon
Can be set to monitor a directory on the system in the background and log any changes that occur as a result of the user or other processes. Also generates encrypted backup copies. This was an academic project and thus is intended to run on a specific server structure supported by UT Dallas. The only changes necessary to run this on a different Linux system is to update the Makefile paths to your own libraries and download required dependencies such as Crypto++.
