# Description:

#       This configuration file can be altered to
#       change how cs3377dirmond acts. If altered
#       mid-process, then send a SIGHUP signal to
#       cs3377dirmond to update the values.
#
#       The Password and WatchDir fields cannot be
#       altered mid-process, or else the process
#       will stop executing. Boolean values such
#       as 1 and 0 should be represented as TRUE
#       or FALSE, respectively. These restrictions
#       should ensure that the configuration file
#       is always a current representation of the
#       set parameters.
